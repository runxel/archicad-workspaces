# Archicad Workspaces

Repository for my personal Archicad workspaces. ![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/compatibility-23-lightgrey?style=flat-square&logo=archicad&logoColor=white)  
_Your milage may vary._

But while you're here you might want to check out …
- My collection of [Archicad objects](https://github.com/runxel/ArchiCAD-Objects), including their source code; you're free to hack on!
- [GDL for Sublime Text](https://github.com/runxel/GDL-sublime), to make scripting of Archicad GDL objects easier than ever!
- My handcrafted custom [Archicad attributes](https://github.com/runxel/archicad-attributes).
- A personal [Archicad-related wiki](https://runxel.xyz/archicad-wiki/)

_Sharing is caring, guys!_

In the "helpers" directory is the [convertKbdXmlToCsv.py](/helpers/convertKbdXmlToCsv.py) script. Its intended use is to get your wellcrafted keyboard shortcuts with no hassle into Excel for printing or whatever.  
**Tip**: Don't open the CSV directly. Instead open a fresh Excel sheet and import the csv via `Data > From CSV`.
Also note: You need to have Python 3 installed. This script needs to be altered if you have another language version and another folder structure (as well as another Archicad version – the XML tends to change from time to time).
