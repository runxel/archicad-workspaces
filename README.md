Repository for my Archicad workspaces. Might or might not work for you. :)

In the "helpers" directory is the [convertKbdXmlToCsv.py](/helpers/convertKbdXmlToCsv.py) script. Its intended use is to get your wellcrafted keyboard shortcuts with no hassle into Excel. Tip: Don't open the CSV directly. Instead open a fresh Excel sheet and import the csv via `Data > From CSV`.
Also note: this script needs to be altered if you have another language version and another folder structure (same goes for another Archicad version – the XML tend to change from time to time).

Also please don't use a [full white or black background↗](https://www.onland.info/archives/2006/04/background_beige_237_236_202.php)!
