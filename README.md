Repository for my Archicad workspaces. Might or might not work for you. :)

In the "helpers" directory is the [convertKbdXmlToCsv.py](/helpers/convertKbdXmlToCsv.py) script. Its intended use is to get your wellcrafted keyboard shortcuts with no hassle into Excel. Tip: Don't open the CSV directly. Instead open a fesh Excel sheet and import the csv via `Data > From CSV`.
Also note: You need to have Python 3 installed. This script needs to be altered if you have another language version and another folder structure (as well another Archicad version â€“ the XML tend to change from time to time).

Also please don't use a full white or black background!...
